<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Throughout history man has sought
stones and minerals for personal adornment
and ornamentation. Stones and
minerals that are sufficiently beautiful,
durable, and rare are known as gemstones.
A gemstone with only one of these qualities
is less desirable than one with all three.
For example, a stone with rich color but
not sufficiently durable to withstand daily
wear in rings finds little favor as a gemstone
except in brooches or pins where the
stone is relatively safe from abrasion. Likewise,
a stone that is beautiful and durable
may be of little interest as a gemstone
because it is commonly found in great
quantities. To be valued highly, gemstones
must be beautiful to the eye, durable
enough to withstand wear, and rare enough
so that they are not easily obtained.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><span class="sc">Properties of Gemstones</span></h3>
<p>The beauty of gemstones is mostly dependent
on their color, diaphaneity, brilliancy,
luster, and fire. Any one or a
combination of these properties render
stones desirable as gems.</p>
<p>Color is very important in many gemstones.
The color of transparent varieties
should be distinct enough to be pleasing
to the eye, yet not so dark as to appear
black or opaque. It is generally more desirable
that the gemstone be of even color
and not appear &ldquo;patchy&rdquo; or &ldquo;streaked.&rdquo;
However, some opaque or translucent
stones such as agate owe their popularity
chiefly to the variety of colors and designs
within a single piece. Some transparent
gemstones exhibit different colors when
viewed in different directions. For example,
some fine blood-red rubies appear
brownish when viewed in a particular
direction. The gemstone should be cut so
that its finest color is most prominently
displayed. This ability of some gemstones
to exhibit different colors when viewed in
different directions is called pleochroism.</p>
<p>Diaphaneity is the relative ability of
stones to transmit light. Diaphaneity is
described by terms such as transparent,
translucent, and opaque. Transparency is
highly desirable in stones such as diamond
that are commonly facet-cut to reflect light.
The gemstone should be water clear and
free from inclusions and cracks so that it
transmits light freely, but there are stones
that do not exhibit this property that are
prized as gemstones. For example, turquoise
may appear to be completely
opaque and not transmit any light, but it
is sought for its fine blue color.</p>
<p>The brilliancy of gemstones is largely
dependent on their index of refraction.
The index of refraction is a measure of
the ability of a cut gemstone to &ldquo;bend&rdquo;
light rays and reflect them from the bottom
facets back through the top of the stone.
Of course, brilliancy is not noted in opaque
or faintly translucent stones. The index of
refraction of gemstones is expressed numerically.
Air is the reference medium
and is assigned an index of refraction of
1.00. Other substances are assigned values
relative to that of air, for example, water,
1.33; topaz, 1.62; diamond, 2.42. The
higher the index of refraction, the more
brilliant will be the gemstone if it is
properly cut and polished.</p>
<p>Luster is the appearance of the mineral
on a fresh surface in reflected light; it is
divided into two major categories, metallic
and non-metallic. Most gemstones have
non-metallic luster and are described by
terms such as vitreous or glassy, resinous,
waxy, greasy, and pearly.</p>
<p>The fire, or ability of gemstones to show
flashes of different colors of light, is dependent
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
upon a property called dispersion.
The amount of dispersion is the extent to
which the gemstone is able to separate
ordinary white light into its component
colors. The dispersion of gemstones can
also be expressed numerically but for purposes
of this publication will be referred
to as low, moderate, or high. Diamond is
a common gemstone that has high dispersion.</p>
<p>A gemstone&rsquo;s durability is primarily
dependent upon its hardness. The Mohs
scale of hardness, given below, is most
commonly used for gemstones and other
minerals.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt class="tu"><b><i>Mohs Scale of Hardness</i></b></dt>
<dt>1. Talc</dt>
<dt>2. Gypsum</dt>
<dt>3. Calcite</dt>
<dt>4. Fluorite</dt>
<dt>5. Apatite</dt>
<dt>6. Orthoclase feldspar</dt>
<dt>7. Quartz</dt>
<dt>8. Topaz</dt>
<dt>9. Corundum</dt>
<dt>10. Diamond</dt></dl>
<p>On this scale, the higher numbers are the
harder minerals. Mohs is a relative, not an
absolute scale. Therefore, it should not be
assumed that diamond is ten times harder
than talc because actually diamond is very
many tens of times harder than talc. However,
a particular mineral is harder than
any other mineral with a lesser number,
and the scale is very convenient to use.
Gemstones mounted in rings should have a
hardness of at least seven on the Mohs
scale, or the stones may become scuffed
and scratched after a relatively short period
of wear. Gemstones mounted in pins
and brooches can be of softer material as
they are not usually subjected to abrasion
and rough treatment.</p>
<p>The tendency of some minerals to split
with relative ease in particular directions
along planes is called cleavage. Cleavage
is also a factor determining the durability
of gemstones. Some gemstones do not exhibit
this tendency at all, whereas others
cleave in several directions. The number
of cleavages is always the same in any one
mineral, and the direction of cleavages is
constant in relation to the crystal structure
of any one mineral or gemstone. It is apparent
that of stones having the same hardness,
the ones lacking cleavage or having
the lesser number of good cleavage directions
are the most durable.</p>
<p>Some stones, such as jade and agate,
owe their durability to their compact
fibrous structure, which makes them very
tough and durable even though they are
not especially hard.</p>
<p>Several other properties of gemstones,
although not always contributing to the
beauty or desirability of gemstones, are
useful in identifying uncut specimens.</p>
<p>Streak is the color of the mineral when
finely powdered or, for softer minerals,
the color obtained by rubbing the mineral
against a piece of unglazed porcelain or
tile. The color of a mineral&rsquo;s streak is
commonly different from the unpowdered
specimen.</p>
<p>Fracture is the kind of surface obtained
when the mineral is broken in a direction
that is not a cleavage direction. Fracture
surfaces are described by such terms as
conchoidal (like the fracture of glass),
subconchoidal, splintery, even, and uneven.</p>
<p>Tenacity is the resistance of a mineral
to breakage. Brittle minerals break relatively
easily on impact. Malleable minerals,
such as gold, may be flattened under
a hammer into very thin sheets without
breaking. Sectile minerals may be cut with
a knife without powdering. Most gemstones,
even diamond, are brittle.</p>
<p>It is only natural to value most those
gemstones that are not common or easy to
obtain. Emerald owes its longstanding
popularity to its fine green color, but tourmaline
is sometimes found in colors that
very closely approach that of emerald and
yet sells for considerably less because it is
so much more common.</p>
<p>Rarity is not the only factor affecting
the value of gemstones. Freedom from internal
imperfections, quality of cutting,
color, and size must also be considered in
cut and polished gemstones. Internal imperfections,
such as inclusions and cracks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
detract from the appearance of gemstones
and interfere with the passage of light between
the facets; consequently, gemstones
containing these imperfections are not
valued as highly as those without them.
Poor cutting or polishing detract from the
beauty and thus from the value of gemstones.
Unpopular or poor color commonly
causes gemstones to be less valuable. Rich
green emeralds are exceedingly prized,
whereas very pale green emeralds are
relatively inexpensive. Diamonds that have
the least hint of yellow are never valued
as highly as pure colorless, pink, or blue
stones. Few persons find the yellowish color
attractive, unless it is a vivid canary
yellow.</p>
<p>Size is important in determining the
value of gemstones but not as important
as perfection. A badly flawed gemstone of
large size may be worth only a slight fraction
of the value of a smaller perfect one.
Gemstone size is usually measured in
carats, a unit of weight, although millimeter
size is sometimes used. Five carats
is equal to 1 gram and approximately
28&#8531; grams is equal to 1 ounce avoirdupois.
One one-hundredth (0.01) of a carat
is called a point, and this term is often
used, especially pertaining to very small
gemstones.</p>
<p>The term used to compare the relative
weights of minerals and gemstones is
specific gravity, which is expressed numerically
in relation to water. Water is
assigned the value of 1.00. Therefore, at
a given temperature a gemstone having a
specific gravity of 2.00 is twice as heavy
as an equal volume of water. A 1-carat
sapphire (specific gravity about 4.00)
will be smaller than a 1-carat amethyst
(specific gravity about 2.65) because the
heavier material will occupy less volume
to have the same weight.</p>
<p>A summary of properties helpful in
identification of common Texas gem
minerals is given in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>Comparatively recently in the history of
gemstones, man has succeeded in the
production of synthetic gems that have
properties closely approaching those of
many natural gemstones. To the untrained
eye some synthetic gems may appear
identical to natural stones, but synthetic
gems can be detected with little difficulty
by a properly equipped expert. Although
most synthetic gems are inexpensive, their
manufacture has not adversely affected the
value of natural gemstones but instead
has increased the demand for fine natural
gems.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><span class="sc">Crystals</span></h3>
<p>Gemstones that have an orderly internal
molecular arrangement are referred to as
crystalline. This internal order is commonly
reflected in the external shape of
&ldquo;rough&rdquo; or uncut gemstones. The resultant
shape is a polyhedral solid bounded by
planes and called a crystal. Well-formed
crystals are formed in nature only under
relatively ideal conditions of temperature,
pressure, and space. The specific temperatures
and pressures involved vary with
different minerals, but most crystals need
space in which to form so that their
&ldquo;growth&rdquo; is not impaired by surrounding
rocks and minerals. However, some minerals,
such as garnet and tourmaline, can
grow in metamorphic rocks by recrystallization
of minerals in the metamorphic
rocks. The size of crystals varies from
microscopic to tens of feet. Any one
mineral usually has one or two typical
crystal forms or arrangements of plane
surfaces that aid greatly in the identification
of the mineral when it occurs in good
crystals (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Frequently gemstones
are found as abraded stream-rolled pebbles,
fragments, or masses that do not
show crystal form. Crystals of the same
mineral from different locations commonly
show somewhat different crystal
forms owing to slight differences in composition
or conditions of formation.
Mineralogists and crystallographers classify
crystals by the symmetry that they
exhibit. The crystal systems are (1) isometric
or cubic, (2) tetragonal, (3) hexagonal,
(4) orthorhombic, (5) monoclinic,
and (6) triclinic. A complete description
of the classification of crystals can be
found in almost any mineralogy text (see
Selected References, p. 34).</p>

<p>Some gemstones, such as opal and
obsidian, never occur as crystals owing to
a lack of internal structural order. Such
gemstones are termed amorphous, or without
form. Amorphous gemstones mostly
occur in nature as irregular lumps or
masses, cavity fillings, or veins.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CUTTING AND POLISHING OF GEMSTONES</h2>
<p>There are two types of widely used gemstone
cuts. Opaque or figured gemstones
are usually cut with a rounded upper surface
and a flat or rounded back. A stone
cut in this fashion is termed a cabochon
or is said to be cabochon cut. There are
several variations of this mode of cutting
(<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). Precious opal, agate, jade, star
sapphire, and fossil wood are some of the
stones that are cut mostly as cabochons.
Transparent gemstones are usually cut
with many plane polished surfaces. Such
stones are called faceted, and the process
of cutting and polishing these stones is
called faceting. Emerald, diamond, topaz,
and garnet are examples of gemstones that
are commonly seen as faceted stones.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/i02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="60" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span> Variations of the cabochon cut. Left to right: double cabochon; flat cabochon; simple cabochon; hollow cabochon.</p>
</div>
<p>The cutting of gemstones, although
sometimes tedious and time consuming, is
not especially difficult or complex. However,
like most arts and crafts, technique
and ability should improve with practice
and experience. There are currently many
amateur gem cutters in Texas. A complete
set of equipment necessary to cut cabochon
stones may be purchased for as little
as $50.00 or $60.00. Most amateur cabochon
cutters have equipment that cost less
than $100.00 which enables them to do
very fine work on many gem materials.
Facet cutting requires more precise equipment,
and a complete array of such usually
costs more than $100.00, although less
expensive equipment can be obtained. The
beginning gem cutter or lapidary who is
willing to assemble and make some of his
own equipment can reduce his initial expenses
considerably.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">Cabochon Gems</span></h3>
<p>The procedures listed herein for gem
cutting do not apply to all gemstones.
Stones that are especially brittle, soft, or
difficult to polish require additional procedures
or special techniques. Many lapidaries
may deviate from these procedures.
Some of the steps of cutting and polishing
are merely matters of personal opinion
and vary somewhat from cutter to cutter.
There are several detailed texts on the art
of gem cutting; the descriptions herein
are designed to give the reader only a
general idea of the procedures and techniques
involved.</p>
<p>The cutting and polishing of cabochons
require several steps. The initial step is
sawing. Assuming that the rough gem
material is large enough to be sawed
(larger than about half an inch in
diameter), it is clamped into the carriage
of a diamond saw (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) and cut into
slices about &#8540;-inch thick. The blade of
the saw is mild steel that has been impregnated
with diamond dust around the
edge, hence the name diamond saw. The
blade is rotated rapidly, and the material
to be cut is &ldquo;fed&rdquo; to the blade by a sliding
carriage on which the gem material is
clamped. The extreme hardness of the
diamond dust in the edge of the blade
enables the saw to cut through several
inches of gem material in a few minutes.
The lower portion of the saw blade is
immersed in a mixture of kerosene and
oil, and the rotating saw blade carries with
it some of the kerosene-oil mixture; this
acts as a coolant and lubricant for both
the saw blade and the material being cut.
Without this lubricant, the heat generated
by sawing would shatter most gem materials
and also damage the saw blade. As
this &ldquo;slicing&rdquo; or sawing of the material
usually takes several minutes, a weight
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
and pulley are generally used to give the
gem material the necessary pressure
against the saw blade. When cut through,
the &ldquo;slab&rdquo; of gem material falls into the
kerosene-oil mixture at the bottom of the
saw or onto a special platform that cushions
its fall.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/i02a.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="573" />

<dt>Weight</dt></dl>
<p>After being sawed, the slab of gem material
is examined, and the location and
size of the stones to be cut from the slab
are determined. The desired outline of the
shape of the gem to be cut is marked on
the slab with a pointed piece of aluminum
rod; ordinary pencil marks are not used
because they wear away too quickly in the
cutting process. Once the area from which
the gem is to be cut has been selected and
the outline of the gemstone has been
marked on the slab, the excess material is
trimmed away by a smaller diamond saw
known as a trim-saw. In some slabs the
excess material can be broken and
&ldquo;nibbled&rdquo; away with a strong pair of
pliers.</p>
<p>The remaining portion of the stone is
usually held by hand and ground to the
desired shape using the previously scribed
mark as a guide. This is done using a
relatively coarse-grained (about 150 grit)
specially made carborundum grinding
wheel.</p>
<p>Now that the desired outline has been
obtained, the stone is firmly affixed to a
slender wooden or hollow aluminum dop-stick
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
(<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). The process whereby the
stone is attached to the dop-stick with a
specially compounded jeweler&rsquo;s wax is
called dopping. The dop-wax is heated
over an alcohol lamp or candle flame until
it is soft and pliable and is then spread
around on the end of the dop-stick and
formed into a mass about the right size
and shape to fit the back of the gemstone.
The stone is likewise heated, and the wax
is applied to the back of the stone while
both wax and stone are hot. Upon cooling,
the wax firmly fixes the stone to the dop-stick.
The dop-stick allows the lapidary to
have firm control of the stone during all
later stages of cutting and polishing.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>CABOCHON</dt>
<dt>DOP-WAX</dt>
<dt>DOP-STICK</dt></dl>
<p>The top of the dopped gemstone is
worked against the coarse carborundum
grinding wheel until it is a rough approximation
of the desired shape. The stone is
then worked against a much finer-grained
(about 220 grit) grinding wheel to remove
the irregularities left by the coarse grinding
and to further smooth and shape the
surface of the gemstone. At all times while
grinding, a small flow of water should be
directed on the grinding wheel to keep the
stone cool. Grinding on the stone for even
a few minutes without cooling may result
in the shattering of the gemstone because
of heat created by friction of the stone
against the grinding wheel. If the lapidary
keeps the surface of the grinding wheel
wet, there is little chance of damaging
most gem materials.</p>
<p>The next phase of cabochon cutting and
polishing is sanding. The gemstone is
worked against two sanding drums of
different grit size. This sanding can be
done with the sandpaper surface either
wet or dry, as needed or as preferred by
the lapidary. However, great care should
be exercised during sanding so that the
stone is not overheated. Overheating can
easily occur whether the sandpaper is
used wet or dry. As in grinding, sanding
is first done on coarser grit paper (about
300 grit) and last on finer paper (about
600 grit). It is in the sanding process that
the first hint of polish is noted on the surface
of the stone. After sanding, the gemstone
should have perfect form with no
surface irregularities, a very finely textured
surface, and only very minor
scratches left from sanding. The gemstone
is now ready to be polished.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span> Cabochons at various stages of cutting and polishing. Left to right: trimmed from slab: ground to outline; after rough grinding; after sanding; polished.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point the procedure depends on
the nature of the gemstone being polished.
Most gem materials are worked against a
buffing wheel that is impregnated or saturated
with a mixture of some polishing
compound and water. A soft felt buffing
wheel with cerium oxide as the polishing
agent is used for many materials. The
mixture of cerium oxide and water is
usually applied to the buffing wheel with
a small brush. The lapidary should once
more be careful not to overheat the stone.
If the stone becomes too hot to hold to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
underside of the cutter&rsquo;s wrist, it should
be permitted to cool for a few seconds
before continuing. After polishing on the
buffing wheel, the gemstone should have
a fine, high polish and be free of any
scratches or surface irregularities. The
finished gemstone is removed from the
dop-stick by heating the dop-wax and pulling
the stone loose. Any excess wax that
hardens again before it can be removed
from the stone by hand can be dissolved
away by rubbing with an acetone-soaked
cloth. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> illustrates the desired appearance
of the gemstone at the end of
each of the steps of cutting and polishing.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">Faceted Gems</span></h3>
<p>The principles involved in faceting are
about the same as those in the cutting of
cabochons, but the equipment and technique
are considerably different. The
equipment required for the facet cutting
of gemstones is built into or attached to
a small specially constructed table (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>),
and the unit is commonly called a facet
table. Most faceted gemstones are cut to
obtain the largest flawless stone possible
from the rough material. Therefore, one
of the first and most important steps for
the lapidary is to decide how the stone is
to be cut from the rough crystal or pebble.
The colors that can be obtained from the
gemstone must also be considered, and the
cutting of the stone oriented so that its best
color is displayed. The lapidary also
selects the orientation of the stone in relation
to the cleavage or cleavages. It is
difficult or impossible to polish facets of
gemstones that are cut parallel to a good
cleavage direction.</p>

<p>Once the orientation of the gemstone to
be cut from the rough material has been
determined, the stone is dopped onto a
special metal dop-stick that fits into the
chuck of the facet head. The chuck is
tightened so that the position of the stone
on the end of the arm of the facet head is
firmly fixed, and the facet head is adjusted
so that the first facet that is cut is
the horizontal, top facet of the stone or
table facet (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). The table facet is cut
by grinding the gemstone on a flat cutting
lap that is diamond impregnated (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>).
By minor adjustments of the facet head,
the lapidary can precisely control the location
of the table facet. As soon as the
table facet has been ground to the proper
size, the cutting lap is removed from the
lap plate, and the polishing lap is secured
in place. Many different kinds of polishing
laps and polishing compounds may be
used depending on the properties of the
material being polished. However, one lap
and one polishing compound are usually
sufficient for each gem variety. After the
polishing lap is secured to the lap plate,
the lapidary adjusts the facet head so that
the stone is in exactly the same position
relative to the lap that it was during the
cutting of the table facet. The polishing
lap is run wet or damp with water, as is
the cutting lap, and small amounts of the
polishing compound are applied to the
surface of the lap while the facet is being
polished. The minor scratches left by the
cutting process are gradually removed,
and a fine lustrous polish develops on the
facet. It is especially important to take
care in achieving a perfect polish on the
table facet, as this facet occupies a large
area of the crown of the gemstone. When
the cutting and polishing of the table facet
are completed, the gemstone is still rough
or uncut in all portions except for this
single, large, polished surface.</p>

<p>The gemstone is then removed from the
dop-stick by melting the dop-wax and is
dopped once more so that the plane of the
polished table facet is perpendicular to
the axis of the chuck and arm of the facet
head (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). Great care should be taken
by the lapidary to insure that the table of
the stone is exactly perpendicular to this
axis, or the proper placing of the later
facets on the stone may become very difficult.</p>

<p>Once the stone has been properly dopped
to the table facet, the lapidary is ready to
proceed with the cutting of the outline of
the stone. If it is to be a brilliant cut, the
stone is ground perfectly round in outline;
if it is to be an emerald or step cut, it is
shaped so that it is square or rectangular
in outline. This process is called preforming.
The arm of the facet head is lowered
on the post until it is horizontal, and the
stone is worked against the cutting lap
until the desired shape is obtained. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the preforming process is completed, the
stone should have the desired outline of
the finished gem (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<dt>DOP-STICK</dt></dl>
<p>The lapidary is now ready to proceed
with the cutting of the pavilion of the stone.
The arm of the facet head is raised to the
proper angle for cutting the main pavilion
facets. The angle at which the main facets
are cut is very critical in determining the
beauty of the finished stone. The required
angle at which these facets must be cut
varies with the refractive indices of the
different varieties of gem minerals. If the
facets are not cut at exactly the proper
angle, light entering the top or crown of
the gemstone can pass completely through
the stone, instead of being reflected back
out of the crown facets. The result is a
dull, lifeless stone that appears to have a
&ldquo;hole&rdquo; or &ldquo;fish-eye&rdquo; in the center. Stones
that are cut in this manner are greatly
reduced in value. The angle at which the
facets are cut is controlled by the adjustment
of the height of the arm of the facet
head on the post. The lapidary will continually
adjust this height, because the
angle between the arm and the surface of
the lap changes slightly as the facet is
ground down to its proper place and size.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/i05a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="193" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span> Proper sequence of cutting of the pavilion facets. Left to right: four main facets; all eight main facets; half of the pavilion girdle facets; completed pavilion.</p>
</div>
<p>The standard American brilliant cut
will be used as an example of facet cutting.
Procedure for all other cuts is essentially
the same to this point. After the eight main
pavilion facets have been cut, the cutting
angle is changed a few degrees, the arm
of the facet head rotated slightly, and the
sixteen pavilion girdle facets or &ldquo;skill&rdquo;
facets, as they are often called, are cut
(<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>). The pavilion girdle facets should
meet exactly in the center of the main
facets at the girdle of the stone. The pavilion
girdle facets should neither overlap,
nor should there be any space between
them (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). After the pavilion girdle
facets are cut, the cutting of the pavilion
of the gemstone is completed. The facets
are then polished on the polishing lap at
the same angles and in the same order as
they were cut, and the pavilion of the gem
is completely finished.</p>
<p>The stone is then removed from the dop-stick
by melting the dop-wax and is re-dopped
to the pavilion facets so that the
crown of the stone is now exposed for cutting.
Before the lapidary proceeds with
the cutting of the crown, it is necessary
that the stone be perfectly centered on the
dop-stick and that the plane of the table
facet be perpendicular to the dop-stick and
to the axis of the arm of the facet head.
The eight main facets are cut first, with
numerous adjustments being made by the
lapidary to insure that the proper angle is
maintained (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>). Then the cutting
angle is changed a few degrees, the arm of
the facet head rotated slightly, and the
crown girdle facets are cut. The crown
girdle facets are placed very similarly to
the pavilion girdle facets except that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
are shorter. The crown girdle facets should
be joined in exactly the same way as the
pavilion girdle facets. When these facets
are properly cut, the cutting angle is again
changed, the arm rotated, and the eight
star facets are cut. This completes the cutting
of the crown of the stone. The cutting
lap is removed from the lap plate, and the
polishing lap is secured into place. The
facets are carefully polished in the same
order that they were cut. After the last star
facet has been polished, the stone is removed
from the dop-stick. Any excess dop-wax
is removed from the stone by means
of a solvent, and the full beauty of the
finished gem is revealed.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">Tumbled Gems</span></h3>
<p>One other method of finishing gemstones
that deserves mention is tumbling. &ldquo;Baroque&rdquo;
or &ldquo;free-form&rdquo; stones are produced
in this manner. Loose pebbles or pieces of
gem materials left over from other cutting
processes are placed in a small barrel or
specially constructed box with loose carborundum
grit. The barrel is turned by
means of a small motor, and the abrasion
of the pebbles and grit against each other
tends to round the pebbles and give them
a finely pitted surface. Progressively finer
and finer carborundum grit is used, and
eventually a polishing compound. The
result is several pounds of well-polished
gem pebbles of various shapes and sizes.
These baroque stones have found recent
favor in costume jewelry of modern design.
The tumbling process is rather slow, commonly
requiring several days or weeks.
However, little effort is involved on the
part of the lapidary, and, consequently,
the cost of most tumbled or baroque stones
is quite modest. Only gem material that is
unsuitable for cutting in other manners
should be finished in this way.</p>

<p>Rich brown to yellowish amber has been
found near Eagle Pass, Maverick County,
in Cretaceous coal and on Terlingua Creek,
Brewster County. Although much of this
material is translucent and the quality
suitable for lapidary purposes, the pieces
are seldom more than a fraction of an inch
in diameter.</p>
<p>Occasional finds of poor quality brownish
amber have been reported from the
Tertiary formations of the Gulf Coastal

<p>Augite of gem quality occurs near Eagle
Flat, Hudspeth County, Texas. Although
this material is very dark greenish brown
and not commonly thought of as a gemstone,
lapidaries have used it to fashion
black faceted stones and cabochons that
resemble obsidian. Most of the augite
occurs as loose pieces and crystal fragments
that have weathered out of nearby
igneous rocks; the augite can also be found
in situ in the igneous rocks.</p>
<p>Specimens and pieces of cutting quality
1 inch in diameter are common, and fragments
over 2 inches in diameter have been
found. The augite is associated with black
spinel and some dark gray to black pieces
of natural glass. Although the faceted and
cabochon-cut stones are not particularly
attractive, some of the larger pieces of
augite might be utilized for carving.</p>

<p>Gem-quality beryl has not been reported
in Texas. A discussion of beryl is included
herein because the writer believes it likely
that beryl of gem quality will be found in
Texas as a result of future investigations
and exploration.</p>
<p>Beryl crystals have been found in pegmatite
dikes in Llano, Blanco, and Gillespie
counties. These crystals are commonly
several inches long and exceed 1 inch in
diameter but are very badly fractured.
Most of the beryl crystals do not approach
gem quality and are entirely unsuitable
for any lapidary use. The color of the
crystals found thus far is bluish, greenish,
pinkish brown, yellowish, and colorless.
Some very tiny colorless beryl crystals
have been found that are transparent, but
thus far such crystals have been too small
to be cut into gems.</p>
<p>Fine blue beryl crystals have been found
in the Franklin Mountains near El Paso,
Texas. Unfortunately, these crystals are so
badly flawed and fractured that they are
not suitable for lapidary use.</p>
<p>It seems likely that careful prospecting
of Texas pegmatites will reveal at least
some gem-quality beryl.</p>

<p>Celestite is very seldom cut into gems.
Being very soft, brittle, and having three
cleavages, celestite is completely unsuitable
for jewelry. These same properties
make this mineral exceedingly difficult to
facet; however, faceted stones are seen in
large collections.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/i06.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="300" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span> Common crystal form of Travis County celestite. Same crystal form as shown in <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>, A.</p>
</div>
<p>Fine crystals of colorless and blue gem-quality
celestite (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, A, and <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>) have
been found at Mount Bonnell and other
localities west of Austin, Travis County.
The celestite crystals occur in vugs or
geodes in limestone. The crystals are
mostly white or colorless and fractured
near the base or where attached, but the
tips of the crystals are commonly clear
celestine blue and completely free of
flaws.</p>
<p>Crystals several inches in length have
been found, but the average size is about
1 inch. The smaller crystals are frequently
more transparent and consequently better
suited for cutting. It is very difficult to
obtain crystals that will allow the cutting
of flawless stones of more than 4 or 5
carats.</p>
<p>Bluish and colorless celestite of gem
quality and fine crystals have been found
near Lampasas, Lampasas County, and
near Brownwood, Brown County, but
neither of these localities has been very
productive of good gem material.</p>
<p>Celestite geodes have been found in
parts of Coke, Fisher, and Nolan counties,
but these geodes contain little gem material.</p>

<p>There is only one well-authenticated find
of diamond in Texas. A small brownish
diamond was found in 1911 on section 64,
block 44, Foard County (Sterrett, 1912,
pp. 1040-1041). The exact weight of the
stone has not been recorded, but one
authority estimated that it was of sufficient
size and clarity to yield a cut stone of
about one-quarter carat.</p>
<p>The only diamond-bearing rocks known
in the United States are in Pike County,
Arkansas. Although many other diamonds
have been found in the United States, all
were loose in gravels or streams except for
some stones at the Arkansas locality. The
fact that one diamond was found in Foard
County does not mean that the prospects
of finding more diamonds in Texas are
much better there than anywhere else in
the State. It is highly unlikely that more
than a very few diamonds will ever be
found in Texas, and any stones that may
be found in the future are likely to be
widely scattered.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><span class="sc">Epidote</span></h3>

<p>Llano County has furnished some green
and brownish-green epidote that is suitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
for cutting into cabochons. Most of the
material that approaches gem quality has
come from contact metamorphic zones and
is associated with garnet, quartz, and some
scheelite. Some small cavities in the rocks
contain tiny transparent crystals of gem
quality, but the largest obtainable flawless
faceted stones would probably be less than
15 points.</p>
<p>Faceted stones of epidote are sometimes
known as pistacite owing to their common
pistachio-green color.</p>

<p>Very fine green, transparent fluorite has
been found near Voca, Mason County. The
fluorite occurs as vug fillings in pegmatites,
associated with crystals of pink microcline
and colorless quartz. Most of the vugs have
been completely filled by the fluorite;
therefore, crystals (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) of the fluorite
are not too common. Masses of fluorite
several pounds in weight, rich green, and
quite transparent have been found near
Voca. Transparent pieces an inch or more
in diameter are common.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 15.</span> Common crystal form of fluorite.</p>
</div>
<p>Fluorite is much too soft for everyday
use in jewelry and because of the low refractive
index does not yield brilliant
faceted stones. The perfect four-directional
cleavage, relative softness, and brittle
tenacity of the mineral make it difficult to
facet. Faceted stones are seldom seen outside
of collections. Cabochons are also
difficult to cut from this material, but the
rich color obtained is ample reward for the
time and care necessary in cutting.</p>
<p>Fluorite occurs at several other localities
in Texas, notably in Hudspeth, Brewster,
Presidio, Llano, and Burnet counties, but
not commonly in gem quality or colors
that warrant its use as gem material.</p>
<h3 id="c16"><span class="sc">Fossil Wood</span></h3>
<p>Wood that is buried in silica-rich sediments
is commonly replaced by quartz,
agate, or opal. The wood structure, including
a large number of the annular rings,
knots, small branches, and bark, may be
preserved. This process of replacement by
silica is believed to take considerable time.
Preservations by other means (<i>see</i> Jet,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>) are known, but silica replacements
are most commonly used as gem materials.</p>
<p>Fossil wood is often used by lapidaries
as gem material when mineral replacement
preserves the wood structure sufficiently
well and when various impurities color
the replacement material attractively.</p>
<p>Excellent gem-quality fossil wood (<a href="#plateI">Pl. I</a>, B) has been found at a great number of
localities in Texas. Agatized and opalized
wood occurs in great abundance along the
outcrops of Eocene and Oligocene strata
of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain. Much of
this material is very well suited for cabochons,
bookends, and other lapidary uses.
The preservation is especially good at
numerous localities in Washington, Lee,
Fayette, and Gonzales counties, and the
variety of colors, such as bluish, gray,
brown, red, yellow, and black, makes this
material especially sought after by &ldquo;rock-hounds.&rdquo;
Some of the agatized and opalized
wood fluoresces yellow or green under
ultra-violet light. The fossil wood is sometimes
found as stumps, limb sections, or
large trunk fragments, but the great majority
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
of the gem material is found as small
broken fragments or stream-rolled cobbles.</p>
<p>Fossil palm wood is by far the most
sought after variety because this material
displays &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; and tube-like structures
that yield very attractive cabochons and
cabinet specimens. Texas fossil palm wood
is highly regarded by cutters from all parts
of the country, and this material is thought
by many lapidaries to be some of the finest
gem-quality fossil wood in the United
States.</p>
<p>Gravel pits and river gravels in Live
Oak County have produced very fine agatized
wood. Although the gem material
does not seem to be as abundant in this
area as it is in counties to the northeast,
the vivid colors and excellent preservation
of the fossil wood in Live Oak County
have attracted collectors from all over the
State. The fossil wood usually occurs as
large rounded cobbles in the streams.
Much of this material is quite translucent
when cut and contains various shades of
brown, orange, and red.</p>
<p>The gravels of the Rio Grande have
produced some fossil wood in addition to
the excellent agate that is also found there.
Most of the fossil wood found in these
gravels is very well preserved, but the
colors are commonly dull shades of brown.
Occasional fine red and yellow specimens
have been recovered from the Rio Grande
gravels, but these are rare.</p>
<p>Good agatized wood has been found in
and near Palo Duro Canyon, Armstrong
County, about 50 miles southeast of Amarillo.
Large trunk sections are not uncommon,
but most of the material of cutting
quality is obtained from small fragments.
The Palo Duro Canyon fossil wood greatly
resembles the famous Arizona Petrified
Forest wood but is not nearly as plentiful.
The Palo Duro wood contains yellow,
brown, red, and bluish colors most commonly.
Some of the wood-producing area
is within Palo Duro Canyon State Park
which is, of course, closed to collecting.
The surrounding area has been worked
diligently by local collectors, but new
pieces of wood are exposed after heavy
rains.</p>
<p>Webb and Duval counties have also produced
some good fossil wood specimens.</p>

<p>Gadolinite as a cut gem is not seen outside
of large collections; however, it can
be faceted into black opaque stones of little
beauty but of great interest to collectors.
The best known locality of this mineral in
the United States is Baringer Hill, Llano
County, Texas. Unfortunately, this locality
was completely flooded by the completion
of Buchanan Dam in 1938. Masses and
rough crystals of gadolinite weighing over
100 pounds were mined from this locality.
The gadolinite occurred in a large, very
coarse-grained pegmatite dike associated
with quartz, microcline, and fluorite, as
well as allanite, fergusonite, nivenite,
cyrtolite, thorogummite, and various other
rare minerals. Some of the minerals in the
dike occurred in very large masses. One
quartz mass over 40 feet in diameter was
noted, and microcline masses up to 30 feet
in diameter were not uncommon. Much of
the gadolinite was used by industrial firms
as a source of thorium compounds, although
some specimen and gem material
found its way into museums and private
collections. Because the locality was
worked mostly from 1910 to about 1925
and because since 1938 the waters of Lake
Buchanan have completely flooded the
entire area, material from this locality is
now exceedingly difficult to obtain. The
collection of the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D.C., contains a cut and polished
gem of Baringer Hill gadolinite
that weighs 8.6 carats. This mineral is
radioactive because of the presence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
uranium, thorium, and other rare radioactive
elements.</p>
<h3 id="c18"><span class="sc">Garnet</span></h3>
<p>The garnet group of minerals is variable
in composition. Listed below are the pure
members of this group, but garnets found
in nature are usually a mixture of two or
more of these end members.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Aluminum garnet&mdash;</dt>
<dd>Grossularite (calcium-aluminum garnet), Ca&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</dd>
<dd>Pyrope (magnesium-aluminum garnet), Mg&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</dd>
<dd>Almandite (iron-aluminum garnet), Fe&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</dd>
<dd>Spessartite (manganese-aluminum garnet), Mn&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</dd>
<dt>Iron garnet&mdash;</dt>
<dd>Andradite (calcium-iron garnet), Ca&#8323;Fe&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;; may contain magnesium, titanium, and yttrium</dd>
<dt>Chromium garnet&mdash;</dt>
<dd>Uvarovite (calcium-chromium garnet), Ca&#8323;Cr&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</dd></dl>
<p>Since almandite is the only variety of
garnet known to occur commonly in gem
quality in Texas, the following properties
are for almandite except where noted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Crystal system</i>: isometric (all varieties). <i>Hardness</i>:
about 7.5. <i>Specific gravity</i>: 4.25. <i>Luster</i>:
vitreous to resinous. <i>Color</i>: red, deep red, and
brownish red (other varieties also yellow, white,
orange, pink, black, and green). <i>Streak</i>: white.
<i>Cleavage</i>: none. <i>Fracture</i>: subconchoidal to uneven.
<i>Tenacity</i>: brittle to tough. <i>Diaphaneity</i>:
transparent to subtranslucent. <i>Refractive index</i>:
about 1.83.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good crystals of gem-quality almandite
garnet have been found in Llano, Blanco,
Burnet, and Gillespie counties. In southeast
Llano County, northwest Blanco
County, and northeast Gillespie County,
the stones mostly occur in stream gravels
where they have collected after being
weathered out of compact mica schists.
Owing to the fact that most of the garnets
have not been transported very far from
their source, the stones commonly show
good crystal form (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, A). All of the
garnets from one locality commonly do not
have exactly the same crystal form. The
garnets are mostly widely scattered in the
stream gravels but can be found concentrated
behind rocks and on small gravel
bars.</p>
<p>Many of the crystals are less than one-eighth
inch in diameter; however, good
crystals one-fourth to one-half inch in
diameter are common. Most of the stones
are too fractured or have too many inclusions
to yield gems, but many transparent
stones have been found. The transparent
crystals usually yield flawless deep red
faceted stones of 2 carats or less. Some of
the stones that contain too many inclusions
to facet are cut as cabochons and are then
often known as carbuncle.</p>
<p>Small garnet fragments have been found
in streams and in gneisses and pegmatites
near Castell, Llano County, but they are
not commonly of gem quality.</p>
<p>Occasional small gem-quality garnets
have been found in pegmatites and contact
metamorphic zones in Burnet County. Garnets
have also been found in several other
counties, notably Mason, El Paso, Hudspeth,
and Culberson, but no stones of facet
quality have been reported.</p>

<p>Jet is a type of fossil wood in which
there has been sufficient chemical change
to make the wood relatively hard and black
without destroying the woody structure.
The best specimens of jet polish into lustrous
black cabochons.</p>
<p>Jet occurs in Presidio County as compressed
and flattened trunks of trees in a
thin layer of coal and lignite in Cretaceous
strata 100 to 200 feet stratigraphically
below the San Carlos beds.</p>
<p>Specimens of &ldquo;jet&rdquo; have been found in
some of the lignitic Tertiary strata of the
Texas Gulf Coastal Plain; however, this
material is mostly soft, brownish, and not
of gem quality.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Very fine facet-quality labradorite has
been found about 20 miles south of Alpine,
Brewster County. The labradorite occurs
loose in the soil as slightly weathered or
frosted cleavage fragments, commonly
showing one or more crystal faces (<a href="#plateII">Pl. II</a>, B). The pale-yellow or straw-yellow
color of these fragments, as well as their
lack of internal imperfections, makes these
stones excellent gem material. Individual
pieces that exceed three-fourths inch in
their longest dimensions are rare. Cut
stones of more than 5 or 6 carats from this
locality are scarce. The source of this material
is uncertain, but it is probably
weathering out of an underlying igneous
rock.</p>
<h3 id="c21"><span class="sc">Microcline</span></h3>

</blockquote>
<p>Very fine crystals of blue microcline
have been found east of Packsaddle Mountain
and near Kingsland in Llano County.
Crystals exceeding 1 foot in length have
been found, although most are only a few
inches long. The color of the microcline is
mostly pale blue, but some crystals are
darker. Microcline crystals associated with
milky or vein quartz, smoky quartz, some
biotite, and rarely cassiterite occur in
pegmatite dikes which vary in size from a
few inches to several feet in thickness. The
color of this microcline is pale in comparison
to microcline from some other localities
in the United States, but the Texas
blue microcline does yield pleasing cabochons.
Perfect crystals of this material
are prized by collectors. Blue or greenish
microcline is often called amazonite or
amazon stone.</p>
<p>Bluish microcline associated with quartz
and topaz has also been reported near
Katemcy, Mason County.</p>
<p>Red microcline is common in several
central Texas counties and is a primary
constituent of many of the igneous rocks
in those counties. Large crystals of perthitic
red microcline occur in pegmatite
dikes of Mason, Llano, Burnet, and Gillespie
counties. Any feldspar quarry or other
pegmatite mining operation in any of these
counties is likely to contain large red microcline
crystals and fragments. Unfortunately,
the good crystals that may have
been present are often shattered by blasting
during quarrying operations.</p>
<p>Feldspar quarries in northeastern Gillespie
County have yielded some good red
cabochon material as well as good crystals.
Here the microcline occurs with milky
and smoky vein quartz, smoky quartz crystals,
clear quartz crystals, greenish muscovite,
and biotite. Many of the older quarries
in Gillespie County have not been
active for some time, and the dumps and
quarry walls have been diligently searched
by collectors.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span> Crystal faces on microcline specimen shown in <a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>, A.</p>
</div>
<p>Many of the pegmatite dikes near Lake
Buchanan in Llano and Burnet counties
have produced some good red microcline
specimens and cutting material (<a href="#plateIII">Pl. III</a>,
A, and <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). Many of these crystals are
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
more pinkish than those in Gillespie
County, but this is commonly due to the
fact that the crystal faces of the Lake
Buchanan area crystals are somewhat more
weathered than the fresh Gillespie County
crystals.</p>
<p>Numerous other local areas in the counties
mentioned, as well as some localities
in Hudspeth and Culberson counties, have
also produced small amounts of red and
pink microcline of gem quality.</p>

<p>Gem-quality black and dark-gray obsidian
has been found in Presidio County
associated with extrusive igneous rocks.
The obsidian in this area is too opaque to
serve as attractive faceted stones but is
found in pieces of sufficient size and quality
to yield nice cabochons. Some of the
small weathered pieces of this material
resemble tektite in outward appearance;
in fact, the &ldquo;valverdites&rdquo; mistaken originally
for tektites are pebbles of weathered
obsidian in terrace gravel of Val Verde
County. Obsidian takes a high polish but
is very sensitive to heat. Stones that are
slightly overheated during grinding or
sanding will quickly shatter.</p>
<p>Obsidian of gem quality has been reported
also in Brewster County.</p>

<p>Opal other than as fossil or opalized
wood (<a href="#Page_20">pp. 20-21</a>) occurs at the following
several localities in Texas.</p>
<p>Approximately 16 miles south of Alpine,
Brewster County, precious opal occurs in
very small seams and as cavity fillings in
very hard pinkish-brown rhyolite. This
opal is milky or bluish and commonly exhibits
small flashes of blue, green, red, and
orange fire. Individual pieces of this opal
are mostly quite small, rarely over one-fourth
inch in diameter, and very difficult
to remove from the tough rhyolite matrix.
Local lapidaries have cut interesting cabochons
from this material in which several
small patches of opal that are close together
in the matrix are included in the
same cabochon.</p>
<p>Small finds of opal associated with rhyolites
and basalts have come from other
localities in west Texas, but the opal
mostly does not display enough play of
colors to warrant its use as gem material.</p>
<p>Near Freer, Duval County, some very
attractive common opal has been found.
The opal is colored various shades of pink,
blue, and yellow and in certain local areas
occurs as fragments that are cemented
together by clear chalcedony. Various
colors are commonly found in the same
piece, and such material yields handsome
cabochons. Although the area has never
been worked commercially, it has been
hunted by collectors and cutters for several
years.</p>
<h3 id="c24"><span class="sc">Pearl</span></h3>
<p>Pearls are the result of the secretion of
calcium carbonate by various shellfish
around sand grains, parasitic organisms,
shell fragments, or other foreign objects
that have in some way entered the body
cavity of the shellfish. Since the shellfish
is unable to expel these irritating particles
or organisms, it deposits successive layers
of calcium carbonate around the foreign
substance to make it smoother and less
irritating. Although pearls are principally
calcium carbonate, they also contain small
amounts of an organic substance, called
conchiolin, and water. Pearls are found in
shellfish that live in either fresh or salt
water. Few pearls are spherical in shape;
most are rounded but somewhat irregular
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
and are known as baroque pearls. Good
quality pearls are the only gemstone commonly
sold by the grain, a unit of weight
equal to 0.25 carat or 0.05 gram. The pearl
grain is not the same unit of weight as the
Troy grain.</p>
<p>In Texas, pearls have been found in
fresh-water clams in most of the major
rivers and streams, notably in the Brazos,
Concho, Colorado, Guadalupe, Llano,
Nueces, Sabine, Rio Grande, and Trinity
Rivers. Several Texas lakes have also
yielded pearls, notably Caddo Lake and
other lakes in north-central and northeast
Texas.</p>
<p>Small pearls are frequently found along
the Texas Gulf Coast in edible oysters and
other common shellfish. Fossil pearls have
also been found but because of their
darkened appearance are of value only as
curiosities.</p>
<p>The pearls thus far found in Texas have
been of relatively poor quality and show
little or no iridescence. These pearls have
little value except as curiosities, although
one writer has stated that the discovery
of pearls in the Nueces River led to the
original Spanish settlement of the State
(Baker, 1935, p. 569).</p>
<h3 id="c25"><span class="sc">Quartz</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Composition</i>: SiO&#8322;. <i>Crystal system</i>: hexagonal.
<i>Hardness</i>: 7. <i>Specific gravity</i>: 2.65 to 2.66 in crystals.
<i>Luster</i>: vitreous, also waxy, greasy, and dull.
<i>Color</i>: most often colorless, brown, yellow, violet;
sometimes green, red, blue, and black; cryptocrystalline
varieties often variously colored by
impurities. <i>Streak</i>: white. <i>Cleavage</i>: indistinct.
<i>Fracture</i>: conchoidal to splintery. <i>Tenacity</i>:
brittle to tough. <i>Diaphaneity</i>: transparent to
opaque. <i>Refractive index</i>: 1.544 to 1.553.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quartz family gemstones can be divided
into two groups for purposes of
description. The first group is the crystalline
varieties, or those quartz varieties that
commonly occur in distinct crystals. The
second group is the cryptocrystalline varieties,
or those quartz varieties that occur
as irregular masses that are composed of
many microscopic crystals. The crystalline
varieties are usually much more transparent
and are most often seen as faceted
stones. The cryptocrystalline varieties vary
from subtransparent to opaque and are
almost always cut as cabochons.</p>
<h3 id="c26"><span class="small">CRYSTALLINE VARIETIES</span></h3>
<p id="c27"><i>Amethyst</i> (violet to purple-colored
quartz).&mdash;A northeastern Gillespie County
locality known as Amethyst Hill has
produced quite a number of fine light to
medium violet amethyst crystals which
occur in quartz veins and geodes associated
with serpentine and talc. Many crystals
have been found loose in the soil.</p>
<p>The amethyst tends to be very irregularly
colored in zones parallel to the crystal
faces. In many, the base of the crystal
is colorless or white and only the termination
is violet. Crystals up to 3 inches long
have been found at this locality, but the
average size is much less.</p>
<p>The surface at this locality is almost
entirely depleted of amethyst, with only
an occasional small crystal or fragment
to be seen. However, small excavations are
still sometimes productive.</p>
<p>Good groups of pale amethyst crystals
have been found in quartz veins near the
old town site of Oxford, Llano County.
The occurrence seems to be much the same
as the Amethyst Hill locality. Little exploration
for gemstones has been done in
this area, and future discoveries seem
likely.</p>
<p>Chalcedony geodes lined with amethyst
crystals have been found in Brewster, Presidio,
Culberson, and Hudspeth counties,
but the occurrences are scattered. The
crystals are seldom large enough to yield
gems of more than 3 carats and are mostly
very light colored.</p>
<p>A few pieces of gem-quality amethyst
have been found in Burnet County.</p>
<p id="c28"><i>Citrine</i> (yellow quartz).&mdash;Very little
gem-quality citrine has been reported in
Texas. Some small citrine crystals have
been found at Amethyst Hill in northeastern
Gillespie County, but few are of sufficient
size or color to yield good gems.</p>
<p>The writer has seen one citrine crystal
that was found in the gravels of a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
stream in eastern Llano County near Buchanan
Dam. The crystal weighs about 1
ounce and is perfectly clear, light golden
yellow, and flawless. However, a further
search of the stream gravels failed to
produce any other citrines.</p>
<p id="c29"><i>Rock crystal</i> (colorless quartz).&mdash;Numerous
localities in Texas produce this
colorless variety of quartz, which is the
most common variety of facet quality
quartz and consequently is of little value.</p>
<p>Rock crystal occurs at many localities
in Burnet, Llano, and Mason counties.
The crystals mostly occur in pegmatite
dikes or in stream gravels where they have
been weathered out of their parent rock.
Some fine colorless quartz crystals have
been found near Voca, Mason County, in
weathered pegmatite dikes and also loose
in the sands of nearby streams. Crystals
from this locality are often stained with
reddish iron oxide on their outer surfaces.
Some of the rock crystal found near
Katemcy, Mason County, shows asterism
when cut with the proper orientation. Fine
clear colorless crystals up to 8 inches long
have been found in the pegmatite dikes
near Lake Buchanan in both Llano and
Burnet counties. Several localities near
Enchanted Rock in Llano County have
also produced some good colorless crystals.</p>
<p>Feldspar quarries in large pegmatites
in northeastern Gillespie County have
yielded attractive quartz crystals, some of
which contain smoky phantom crystals and
tourmaline inclusions.</p>
<p>Some pieces of rock crystal enclosing
green, needle-like actinolite crystals have
been found near the Llano-Gillespie-Blanco
County corner. This material is not
suitable for faceted gems but does lend
itself to interesting and attractive cabochons.</p>
<p>Colorless quartz crystals commonly are
found lining small chalcedony geodes in
Brewster, Presidio, Culberson, Hudspeth,
Reeves, and Jeff Davis counties. These
crystals are most commonly less than 1
inch long but are mostly very clear.</p>
<p>Rock crystal has been found in crevices
of petrified wood in many east and southeast
Texas counties, although the crystals
are mostly quite small.</p>
<p>Many lesser occurrences of rock crystal,
too numerous to mention, are located within
the State.</p>
<p id="c30"><i>Rose quartz</i> (pink quartz).&mdash;Rose
quartz occurs at various localities in Burnet,
Llano, Mason, and Gillespie counties,
but the amount of material is mostly small
and the greater part unsuitable for gem
purposes. Some good pink rose quartz occurs
near Town Mountain, Llano County,
but this material does not have flawless
areas large enough to yield faceted stones
of more than a few carats. Rose quartz
is always slightly milky, or cloudy, and
does not cut into brilliant faceted stones.
The Town Mountain rose quartz has been
cut into attractive cabochons.</p>
<p id="c31"><i>Smoky quartz</i> (brown, yellow-brown,
and golden-brown quartz).&mdash;Several
Texas localities have produced fine smoky
quartz. Baringer Hill, a noted rare-earth
minerals pegmatite locality in Llano
County, contained some smoky quartz
crystals that were estimated to weigh over
1,000 pounds, and the locality produced
many smaller crystals that were of gem
quality. Baringer Hill was flooded by the
completion of Buchanan Dam in 1938 and
is presently under the waters of Lake
Buchanan. A few fine golden-brown gem-quality
crystals have been found along the
lake shore and in small pegmatites nearby
(<a href="#plateIII">Pl. III</a>, B.).</p>
<p>Feldspar quarries in northeastern Gillespie
County have produced smoky quartz
crystals that exceed 1 foot in length, but
these crystals are mostly flawed, possibly
as a result of blasting, and mostly contain
only small clear areas.</p>
<p>Good color smoky quartz crystals are
found with topaz in the pegmatites and
stream beds in Mason County, near
Streeter, Grit, and Katemcy. These crystals
tend to be lighter colored than those near
Lake Buchanan, but they commonly contain
large flawless areas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h3 id="c32"><span class="small">CRYPTOCRYSTALLINE VARIETIES</span></h3>
<p id="c33"><i>Chalcedony.</i>&mdash;When free from impurities
of various oxides and other compounds,
chalcedony has little to render it
pleasing as a gemstone. It is mostly gray,
white, brown, or bluish and commonly has
a waxy luster. Some of the chalcedony
found along the Rio Grande Valley and in
west Texas will take dyes, and local lapidaries
have had some success in dyeing this
material various shades of blue, green,
yellow, and red. When the chalcedony is
naturally colored and variegated, usually
in bands, mossy figures, or dendritic
forms, it is called agate.</p>
<p id="c34"><i>Agate</i> (variegated chalcedony).&mdash;The
wide variety of markings and colors available
together with the ease of cutting make
agate a favorite of many lapidaries. Fine
agate has been found at numerous localities
in west and south Texas. Fine plume
agate, famous throughout the United
States, is found south of Alpine. Plume
agate is characterized by dendritic or tree-like
inclusions and is mostly cut into very
handsome cabochons. The agate from
south of Alpine commonly contains black,
red, yellow, or brown plumes within the
same piece. The variety of colors and lack
of porosity of this agate make it highly
desired among lapidaries. The agate occurs
loose on the surface of the ground and
in the soil in small nodules that have a
very rough, brownish surface. These
nodules are mostly less than 3 inches in
diameter, although specimens of gem quality
have been found that exceed 200
pounds.</p>
<p>Some very fine agate has been found in
the vicinity of Needle Peak, Presidio
County. This material is mostly green moss
agate in clear chalcedony and commonly
contains small yellow &ldquo;sun-burst&rdquo; figures.
The contrasting yellow and green design
makes very beautiful cabochons.</p>
<p>Fine agate has been found south of
Marfa, Presidio County. This agate is
mostly clear chalcedony with black, yellow,
or variously colored plumes, moss, or
&ldquo;bouquet-like&rdquo; figures.</p>
<p>Numerous other localities in Presidio
and Brewster counties have produced good
agate.</p>
<p>Various amounts of agate, jasper, and
chalcedony occur in the gravels of the Rio
Grande in varying quantities from Big
Bend National Park downstream to
Brownsville. This agate is found both in
the present river gravels and in the older
river gravels that now are located on
nearby hills and slopes up to several miles
north or south of the present Rio Grande.
The greatest concentration of agate and related
gem materials seems to be in the area
between Laredo and Rio Grande City.
Vast quantities of excellent gem material
have been removed from this area for
many years (<a href="#plateIV">Pl. IV</a>). The agate occurs
as rounded, stream-worn cobbles and commonly
has a thin white coating that makes
it difficult to distinguish from the abundant
chert and other rocks. The agate
occurs in cobbles that are mostly 3 to 6
inches in diameter, but specimens of gem
quality that exceed twice this size are
known. The agate varies greatly in design
and color. Plume, moss, banded, and sagenitic
agate occur in these gravels in a
wide variety of colors. The jasper in the
Rio Grande gravels is yellow, red, green,
or various shades of these and is commonly
suspended as angular fragments in clear
chalcedony.</p>
<p>Good agate has also been found near
Balmorhea in Reeves and Jeff Davis counties
and in smaller amounts at numerous
other west and south Texas localities.</p>
<p id="c35"><i>Agatized wood</i> (<i>see</i> Fossil wood, <a href="#Page_20">pp. 20-21</a>).</p>
<p id="c36"><i>Carnelian</i> (translucent reddish chalcedony).&mdash;This
variety of chalcedony in
small quantities has been reported from
near Van Horn, Hudspeth County. Small
pieces of carnelian have been found in the
gravels of the Rio Grande, but finds have
been few and scattered.</p>
<p id="c37"><i>Jasper</i> (impure opaque or subtranslucent
quartz).&mdash;Good green, yellow, red,
and brown jasper has been found in the
gravels of the Rio Grande at all of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
localities that produce agate. The colors
are quite vivid, and the material takes a
fine polish. Some pieces of orbicular jasper
(jasper with circular or eye-like markings)
have been found in this material.
These gravels commonly contain jasper as
fragments that are suspended in clear
chalcedony; this is called brecciated jasper
and yields very handsome cabochons.</p>
<p>Many of the west Texas agate localities
also produce jasper in quantity. Good jasper
has been reported from north of

<p>Some feldspars, including sanidine,
show a nice blue sheen in reflected light
parallel to certain crystallographic directions.
Stones having this property are
called moonstone. A clear yellowish sanidine
showing an attractive blue sheen has
been found in Brewster, Jeff Davis, and
Presidio counties. The individual pieces
are small, the average size being about
one-eighth inch. The sanidine is found
loose in the soil at some localities where it
has weathered out of rhyolite, and specimens
of the sanidine in the parent rock are
not difficult to obtain. Very small cabochons
can be cut from this material, but
few lapidaries have done so because inexpensive
larger pieces of moonstone can be
obtained easily from foreign sources. However,
the west Texas sanidine does show a
blue sheen when cut and polished.</p>

<p>In many areas of the world, fine quality,
beautifully colored, transparent spinels are
found and used as gems. The only gem-quality
spinel reported thus far in Texas
is black and opaque. Near Eagle Flat in
Hudspeth County, black spinel crystals
have been found associated with augite
and natural glass; these minerals are
weathering out of an intrusive igneous
rock. The spinel crystals have an octahedral
form which is common for this mineral
(<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). Most of the spinels are free
of flaws, but because of their black color
they have little value as gems. The crystals
are found loose in the sand of streams near
the outcrops of the igneous rock or embedded
in the rock. They seldom exceed
half an inch in diameter. These stones are
primarily sought by collectors.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The average bediasite size is about 1
inch in diameter, although specimens approximately
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
3 inches in diameter are
known. The uncut tektites are very interesting,
showing a variety of shapes and
surface features (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, A) and many exhibit
contorted flow structure. The surface
of many tektites is grooved or furrowed,
while on others it is smooth or frosted.
The Texas tektites are known as &ldquo;bediasites,&rdquo;
after place names in Grimes County
traceable to the Bedias Indians who formerly
lived there.</p>
<p>Dark brown and greenish-brown tektites
have been found in Texas in gravels at
scattered localities in Walker, Grimes,
Brazos, Burleson, Lee, Fayette, Gonzales,
Lavaca, and DeWitt counties. Outside of
Texas the only other authenticated tektite
localities in the United States at the present
time are in Dodge and Irwin counties,
Georgia. A fragment of a similar tektite
has recently been reported from near
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The
tektites reported from Oklahoma are now
known to be pebbles of obsidian.</p>
<p>Although tektites have little value or
beauty as gemstones, they have been cut
by lapidaries as both faceted and cabochon
stones. Tektites take a high polish but are
mostly so dark in color that they appear
black.</p>
<p>The origin of tektites is of great scientific
interest and is currently the subject
of much debate. Some scientists believe
that tektites are of meteoritic origin, while
others believe that tektites were formed
by various terrestrial processes. Since no
one has actually observed a tektite to fall
or form, and many of the theories of origin
are difficult to prove without direct observation,
the origin of tektites is likely to
remain in controversy for some time.</p>

<p>Various yellow and smoky colored
quartz gems are offered for sale as &ldquo;Spanish
Topaz,&rdquo; &ldquo;Smoky Topaz,&rdquo; &ldquo;Madeira
Topaz,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Topaz Quartz.&rdquo; These names
are entirely misleading and should be
dropped from usage.</p>
<p>Fine gem-quality white, pale-blue, and
sky-blue topaz has been found near
Streeter, Grit, and Katemcy, Mason
County. This Texas gem material compares
favorably in color, size, and clarity with
topaz found anywhere in the United States.
Fine crystals of topaz (<a href="#plateV">Pl. V</a>, B, and <a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>) occasionally are found in pegmatite
dikes associated with quartz, black tourmaline,
cassiterite, and pink microcline.
Many of the gem-bearing pegmatites have
been eroded away, leaving the topaz concentrated
in the stream beds. The stones
mostly occur as frosted, stream-worn pebbles
(<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, A) in the numerous small
creeks in the area. The topaz is heavier
than the quartz and microcline that compose
the stream gravel and is commonly
found immediately on top of the granite
bed-rock in the bottom of the stream bed.
The stones tend to lodge behind boulders
or small dikes cutting across the stream.</p>

</div>
<p>The white or colorless stones are by far
the most common, outnumbering the
bluish stones about ten to one. The color
of the blue stones tends to be irregularly
distributed in zones parallel to the crystal
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
faces. Topaz that is colored in this manner
should be cut with the best blue color near
the bottom or culet of the gem (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>).
If done correctly, this will give the entire
gemstone the desirable blue color.</p>

<p>The colorless stones can be turned pale
yellow, yellowish brown, or straw yellow
by exposure to X-ray radiation, and some
of the bluish stones will fluoresce faintly
yellowish under ultra-violet light.</p>
<p>The largest gem-quality topaz crystal
yet found in North America has come from
Mason County. It is a pale-blue crystal
weighing 1,296 grams, now in the collection
of the U.S. National Museum. Several
other large pieces, some weighing over a
pound, have been found. One large crystal,
exact weight unknown, was found near
Katemcy. Several gem cutters have estimated
that this stone could easily yield a
single, flawless pale-blue gem of about 500
carats. Many large gems have been cut
from topaz found in this area, including
at least one stone of over 300 carats.</p>
<p>One obstacle in the cutting of topaz is
its perfect basal cleavage. The gemstone
should be oriented so that no facet of the
stone will be parallel to or within less than
about 5 degrees of the cleavage direction,
or the facet may be very difficult or impossible
to polish.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the productivity
of this area since its discovery in the early
1900&rsquo;s. Few systematic attempts have been
made to exploit the deposits, and a great
amount of the topaz thus far recovered has
been found by private collectors. The
Mason County topaz deposits are still very
productive, and additional exploration
may uncover even more gem-producing
areas.</p>
<p>Topaz has also been found in stream
gravels or pegmatites in Burnet, Llano,
Gillespie, and El Paso counties but very
rarely in gem quality.</p>

<p>Black tourmaline is schorl;
brown tourmaline, dravite.</p>
<p>Good crystals of black and dark brown
tourmaline occur at Town Mountain near
Llano, Llano County. The tourmaline
crystals average about 1 inch in length,
do not commonly exceed 2 inches, and
are associated with white vein quartz.
The quartz completely encloses the tourmaline,
but the crystals can be broken free
or the quartz can be trimmed away with
the use of a diamond saw. The latter procedure
is recommended whenever possible,
for it is very easy to shatter the tourmaline
crystals while trying to remove them from
the quartz by other means. Many of the
crystals are completely unsuitable for cutting,
being too brittle or too badly cracked
and flawed. However, some small crystals
have been found that are of sufficient quality
and size to yield flawless stones of a
few carats. Few of these stones have been
cut since the tourmaline is so dark that it
appears opaque, and few persons find a
gem of this nature attractive.</p>
<p>Good black and dark brown crystals of
tourmaline associated with andalusite and
graphite occur in the Packsaddle schist
(Precambrian) near Sunrise Beach, Llano
County (<a href="#plateVI">Pl. VI</a>, B, and <a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>). Although
generally smaller in diameter than the
crystals found at Town Mountain, they
commonly exceed 3 inches in length, although
the average size is a little over 1
inch. Many of these crystals are suitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
for cutting into opaque or nearly opaque
stones of about 5 or 6 carats.</p>
<p>Black tourmaline has also been found
in Hudspeth and Culberson counties but
not of sufficient quality to be used as a
gemstone.</p>

<p>Turquoise of good sky-blue to greenish-blue
color has been found a few miles
southwest of Van Horn, Culberson County.
Several shallow pits were dug at this locality
about 1910; however, the amount
of turquoise produced was small. The main
occurrence of the turquoise was in seams
about 1 millimeter thick along joints in the
fine-grained rocks of this area. Persons
who have visited Culberson County more
recently report that even minute traces of
the turquoise are now difficult to find at
the old prospect pits. However, further
prospecting in the area might yield some
additional localities.</p>
<p>Small amounts of turquoise have been
reported near El Paso, El Paso County,
and also in volcanic rocks near the Jeff
Davis-Brewster County line, north of Alpine.</p>
<p>A small amount of turquoise has been
mined from several localities a few miles
northwest of Sierra Blanca in the Sierra
Blanca Mountains of Hudspeth County.</p>
